### Terminal Based Weather Analysis

This project will analyze historical weather data and future weather data and offer a menu to the user to choose what data they are interested in looking at. The Geocoding API will be used to get the latitude and longitude information for a city and then the data will be used by the One Call API to get the weather information.

This project is being implemented for the Programming Languages (CSC3200) course.

#### Tools Used

- Weather API: [One Call API 3.0](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-3)
